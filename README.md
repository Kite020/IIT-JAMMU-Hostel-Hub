# IIT-JAMMU-Hostel-Hub
This system is designed to efficiently allocate hostel rooms and floors to students at IIT Jammu. It assigns rooms based on the studentâ€™s year, gender, and hostel preference. The system ensures that 1st-year students are assigned rooms in the designated hostel (Egret), with personalized floor allocations for girls. Meanwhile, boys are allocated rooms in hostels based on their year and branch. The system supports room sharing (two students per room for most hostels) and assigns roommates based on the branch of study, ensuring a balanced living environment for all students.
